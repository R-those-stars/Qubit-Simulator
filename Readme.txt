# Quantum Gate Simulator 🔮💻

An interactive Python-based simulator that visualizes quantum gates, Bloch Spheres, and quantum circuits using Qiskit, Matplotlib, and Tkinter.

## 📌 Features
- Simulate single-qubit gates: X, Y, Z, H, S, T
- Visualize Bloch Sphere representation of qubits
- Plot measurement results as bar graphs
- Display quantum circuits
- Simple GUI for user interaction

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Qiskit
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter
- Numpy

Install all dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 How to Run
python "Quantum Gate Simulator.py"


## 📚 Background
Built as a minor project at NIT Delhi, this simulator aims to make quantum computing concepts more interactive for students.
